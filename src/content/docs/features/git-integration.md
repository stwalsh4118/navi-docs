## Overview

Navi displays git information for each session's working directory: current branch, dirty status, ahead/behind counts, last commit, and GitHub PR detection.

## Inline Display

Each session row shows git info when available:

```
⚙️ my-session                                      3m ago
  ~/projects/app  feature/login ● +3  [PR #42]
```

- **Branch name**: Current branch (truncated to 30 characters)
- **Dirty indicator**: `●` when there are uncommitted changes
- **Ahead/behind**: `+3` commits ahead, `-1` commits behind remote
- **PR number**: `PR#42` when a GitHub PR is detected for the branch

## Detail View

Press `G` to open the git detail view for the selected session. This shows:

- Full branch name
- Remote URL
- Last commit (hash + subject)
- Ahead/behind counts
- GitHub PR link
- Recent diffs (up to 5000 lines)

## GitHub PR Detection

Navi auto-detects GitHub PRs by:

1. Parsing the git remote URL (HTTPS or SSH format)
2. Extracting the owner and repository name
3. Using `gh pr view --json number` to look up PRs for the current branch
4. Caching the result to avoid repeated API calls

The `gh` CLI must be installed and authenticated for PR detection to work.

## How It Works

Git information is polled separately from session status:

- **Local sessions**: Runs `git` commands in the session's working directory
- **Remote sessions**: Executes a bundled git info script over SSH (`cd <cwd> && git branch --show-current && git status --porcelain && ...`)
- **Cache**: Git info is cached with a 5-second TTL and 10-second max age
- **PR cache**: PR numbers are cached per branch to minimize `gh` API calls
