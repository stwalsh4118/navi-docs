## Overview

All TUI panels support scrolling when content exceeds the available space. This includes the session list, task panel, preview pane, and dialog content.

## Scroll Behavior

Each panel tracks its scroll state independently using an integer offset representing the first visible line or item. The viewport is calculated as the panel height minus chrome (borders, headers, footers).

### Auto-Follow Cursor

When navigating with `j`/`k`, the viewport scrolls automatically to keep the cursor visible. If the cursor moves beyond the visible area, the viewport adjusts.

### Scroll Indicators

Panels show position information when content overflows, helping you understand where you are in the content.

## Keybindings

When a panel is focused:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Scroll down one line |
| `k` / `↑` | Scroll up one line |
| `PgDn` | Scroll down one page |
| `PgUp` | Scroll up one page |
| `g` | Go to top |
| `G` | Go to bottom |
