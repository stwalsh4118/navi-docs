## Overview

The task view displays project tasks from any source (GitHub Issues, markdown files, or custom providers) directly in the navi dashboard via a pluggable provider system. Tasks are grouped by project or category with sorting, filtering, progress indicators, and summary statistics to help manage large backlogs efficiently.

## Quick Start

1. Create a `.navi.yaml` in your project root:

```yaml
tasks:
  provider: "markdown-tasks"
  args:
    path: "docs/delivery"
```

2. Press `T` in navi to toggle the task panel

## Using the Task Panel

The task panel appears alongside the session list. Tasks are grouped by project or category.

### Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `T` | Toggle task panel visibility |
| `Tab` | Focus task panel (when visible) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate tasks |
| `Space` | Expand / collapse task group |
| `/` | Search tasks |
| `Enter` | Open task (URL or file viewer) |
| `r` | Refresh tasks (invalidate cache) |
| `[` / `]` | Resize task panel |
| `s` | Cycle sort mode |
| `S` | Toggle sort direction |
| `f` | Cycle filter mode |
| `J` | Jump to next group header |
| `K` | Jump to previous group header |
| `e` | Toggle expand / collapse all groups |
| `a` | Toggle accordion mode |
| `Esc` | Return focus to session list |

## Sorting

Cycle through sort modes with `s`, reverse direction with `S`.

| Mode | Order | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **source** | Original provider order | Default — preserves the order your provider returns |
| **status** | Active first, done last | Priority: active → review → blocked → todo → done |
| **name** | Alphabetical (case-insensitive) | Groups sorted by title |
| **progress** | Least complete first | Groups with lowest completion percentage appear first |

All modes use source order as a stable tiebreaker. When sort mode is `status`, tasks within each group are also sorted by status priority.

The header shows the current sort mode and direction (e.g., `sort:status↓`). The indicator is hidden when using the default (source ascending).

## Filtering

Cycle through filter modes with `f`.

| Mode | Shows | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **all** | Every group | Default — nothing hidden |
| **active** | Active, review, or blocked groups | Hides done and todo groups |
| **incomplete** | All except done groups | Shows everything that still has work remaining |

The header shows the active filter and how many groups are hidden (e.g., `filter:active (22 hidden)`). Search operates within the filtered set — hidden groups are not searchable.

## Progress Indicators

Each group header displays a completion counter and mini progress bar:

```
▶ 3. Enhanced Session Creation  [3/5] ██░░  todo
```

- `[3/5]` — completed tasks / total tasks in the group
- `██░░` — 4-character proportional progress bar
- Empty groups show `(0)` instead of a progress bar

Tasks with status "done", "closed", or "completed" count as complete.

## Summary Statistics

When the panel is tall enough, a second header line shows overall task health across all groups (unfiltered totals):

```
  12 done · 3 active · 1 review · 18 todo
```

Each category is color-coded: green (done), cyan (active), magenta (review), red (blocked), yellow (todo). Status strings are normalized to these five canonical categories.

## Group Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `J` | Jump cursor to next group header (wraps to first) |
| `K` | Jump cursor to previous group header (wraps to last) |
| `e` | Toggle expand/collapse all groups |
| `a` | Toggle accordion mode (expanding one group collapses others) |

## Manual Refresh

Press `r` to immediately re-run the task provider, bypassing the cache. The header shows "Refreshing..." while the provider is running. Duplicate refresh requests while one is in progress are ignored.

## Task Providers

### Built-in: markdown-tasks

Scans markdown files for task definitions. Designed for projects using the delivery documentation pattern.

```yaml
tasks:
  provider: "markdown-tasks"
  args:
    path: "docs/delivery"
```

### Built-in: github-issues

Fetches issues from a GitHub repository using the `gh` CLI.

```yaml
tasks:
  provider: "github-issues"
  args:
    repo: "owner/repo"
```

### Custom Providers

Any executable script that outputs the standard JSON format works as a provider. The script receives arguments from the `args` field in `.navi.yaml`.

Expected output format:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "group-1",
      "title": "Sprint 1",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "url": "https://...",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "task-1",
          "title": "Fix login bug",
          "status": "todo",
          "assignee": "alice",
          "labels": ["bug", "auth"],
          "priority": 1,
          "url": "https://...",
          "created": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
          "updated": "2026-01-02T00:00:00Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

### Per-Project (`.navi.yaml`)

```yaml
tasks:
  provider: "markdown-tasks"
  args:
    path: "docs/delivery"
  interval: "30s"              # Refresh interval (optional)
```

### Global (`~/.navi/config.yaml`)

```yaml
tasks:
  default_provider: "markdown-tasks"
  interval: "30s"
```

Task results are cached and refreshed at the configured interval (default 30 seconds).

### Runtime State

Sort mode, filter mode, sort direction, and accordion mode are session-persistent (stored in memory) but do not persist across restarts.
