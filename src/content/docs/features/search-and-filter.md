## Overview

Navi provides exact-match search with next/previous cycling, status filters, and multiple sort modes to help you quickly find sessions when managing many of them.

## Search

Press `/` to activate search mode. Type to filter sessions by name, directory, or message. Navi uses **exact substring matching** (case-insensitive) — not fuzzy matching.

During search:
- All sessions remain visible
- Matching sessions are highlighted
- A match counter shows your position (e.g., "2/5 matches")
- The cursor automatically jumps to the first match

### Cycling Through Matches

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | Jump to next match |
| `N` | Jump to previous match |
| `Enter` | Confirm and exit search mode |
| `Esc` | Exit search mode |

## Status Filters

Filter sessions by their current status:

| Key | Filter |
|-----|--------|
| `0` | Show all sessions (clear filter) |
| `1` | Waiting sessions only |
| `2` | Working sessions only |
| `3` | Permission sessions only |
| `4` | Done sessions only |
| `5` | Error sessions only |

Press `o` to toggle visibility of offline sessions.

For remote sessions, press `f` to cycle through filter modes:
- **All**: Show local and remote sessions
- **Local**: Show only local sessions
- **Remote**: Show only remote sessions

## Sort Modes

Press `s` to cycle through sort modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Priority | Attention-needed first (waiting, permission), then by timestamp |
| Name | Alphabetical by session name |
| Age | Most recently updated first |
| Status | Grouped by status |
| Directory | Grouped by working directory |

## Footer Display

The footer shows the current filter and sort state:

```
Filter: waiting  Sort: priority  10/15 shown
s:sort  1-5:filter  o:offline  0:clear
```
