## Overview

The preview pane shows the last 50 lines of output from the selected session's tmux pane, letting you see what Claude is doing without fully attaching.

## Quick Start

Press `p` to toggle the preview pane. It appears alongside the session list and updates automatically as you navigate between sessions.

## Layouts

Press `L` to cycle through preview layouts:

| Layout | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Side | Sessions on the left, preview on the right |
| Bottom | Sessions on top, preview below |
| Inline | Preview appears below the selected session in the list |

## Interaction

Press `Tab` to focus the preview pane for scrolling. When focused:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Scroll down / up |
| `PgDn` / `PgUp` | Page down / up |
| `g` | Go to top |
| `G` | Go to bottom |
| `Tab` / `Esc` | Return focus to session list |

Press `W` to toggle line wrapping.

Press `[` / `]` to resize the preview pane.

## How It Works

The preview pane captures output using `tmux capture-pane -t <session> -p -S -50`, which extracts the last 50 lines of the tmux pane's scrollback buffer. Content refreshes periodically (every 1-2 seconds) and when the cursor moves to a different session.

For remote sessions, the same command is executed over SSH.
