## Overview

Navi can aggregate Claude Code sessions from multiple remote machines via SSH into a single unified dashboard. Remote sessions have full feature parity with local sessions — you can view git info, preview output, kill, rename, and dismiss them.

## Quick Start

Remote machines are configured via the TUI. Once configured, remote sessions appear in the same list as local sessions, labeled with their host name.

## How It Works

### SSH Polling

Navi connects to each configured remote machine via SSH and reads the session status files:

```bash
cat ~/.claude-sessions/*.json
```

The output is parsed and merged into the local session list. Each remote session's `Remote` field indicates which machine it came from.

### Connection Pooling

SSH connections use `ControlMaster` multiplexing for efficiency. A single SSH connection to each remote is reused across multiple commands (status polling, git info, preview capture, actions).

### Remote Actions

All session management actions work on remote sessions:

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Attach** | `ssh -t user@host "tmux attach-session -t <session>"` |
| **Preview** | `tmux capture-pane -t <session> -p -S -50` over SSH |
| **Git info** | Bundled git commands executed over SSH |
| **Kill** | `tmux kill-session -t <session>` over SSH |
| **Rename** | `tmux rename-session` over SSH |
| **Dismiss** | Status update over SSH |

### Filtering

Press `f` to cycle through session filter modes:

| Mode | Sessions Shown |
|------|----------------|
| All | Local and remote |
| Local | Only local sessions |
| Remote | Only remote sessions |

Remote machines that are offline are handled gracefully — their sessions are marked as offline and the dashboard continues to function.

## Configuration

Remote machines are configured at runtime with:

- **Host**: SSH hostname or IP
- **Port**: SSH port (default: 22)
- **User**: SSH username
- **Session directory**: Path to `~/.claude-sessions` on the remote (default: `~/.claude-sessions`)
- **Cache TTL**: How long to cache remote session data

SSH key authentication is used. Jump host configuration is supported for bastion setups.
