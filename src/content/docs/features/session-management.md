## Overview

Navi provides full session lifecycle management directly from the TUI. You can attach to sessions, create new ones, kill sessions, rename them, and dismiss completed sessions — all without leaving the dashboard.

## Attaching and Detaching

Press `Enter` on any session to attach to it. Navi uses `tmux attach-session -t <session_name>` to connect you directly to the Claude Code session. When you detach from tmux (default: `Ctrl+b d`), control returns to navi automatically.

For remote sessions, attaching opens an SSH connection with tmux: `ssh -t user@host "tmux attach-session -t <session>"`.

## Creating Sessions

Press `n` to open the new session dialog:

1. Enter a session name
2. Enter a working directory (defaults to current directory)
3. Press `Enter` to create

Navi creates a new tmux session with the specified name and directory using `tmux new-session`.

## Killing Sessions

Press `x` on a selected session to kill it. A confirmation dialog appears before the session is terminated. This runs `tmux kill-session -t <session_name>`.

## Renaming Sessions

Press `R` on a selected session to rename it. Enter the new name and press `Enter`. This uses `tmux rename-session`.

## Dismissing Sessions

Press `d` to dismiss a completed session. This resets its status to working, effectively clearing it from the attention-needed list. The session remains active in tmux.

## Refreshing

Press `r` to force an immediate refresh of the session list, bypassing the normal 500ms poll interval.
