## Overview

Navi tracks token usage, time, and tool activity for each session. Metrics are displayed as inline badges in the session list and in a detailed metrics view.

## Inline Display

Each session row can show metric badges:

```
⏱ 1h 23m  🔧 45  📊 57k tokens
```

- **Time**: Total session duration
- **Tools**: Number of tool invocations
- **Tokens**: Total token usage (input + output)

## Detail View

Press `i` on a selected session to open the metrics detail view with full breakdowns.

### Token Metrics

Token usage is extracted from Claude Code session transcript files at `~/.claude/projects/`. Navi maps a session's working directory to its transcript by converting the path (e.g., `/home/sean/workspace/navi` becomes `-home-sean-workspace-navi`) and reading the most recently modified `.jsonl` file.

Token breakdown:
- **Input tokens**: Tokens sent to the model
- **Output tokens**: Tokens generated by the model
- **Cache tokens**: Cache read + cache creation tokens

Thresholds:
- Warning (yellow): 100k tokens
- Critical (red): 500k tokens

Format examples: `0`, `500`, `1.2k`, `45k`, `1.5M`

### Time Metrics

- **Total duration**: Time since session started
- **Working time**: Time actively processing
- **Waiting time**: Time waiting for user input

Format examples: `45s`, `5m`, `1h 23m`, `2h`

### Tool Metrics

Tracked by the `tool-tracker.sh` hook script:

- **Recent tools**: Last 10 tools used (e.g., Read, Write, Bash)
- **Tool counts**: How many times each tool was invoked

## How It Works

1. The `notify.sh` hook writes time metrics (start time, status transitions) to session JSON
2. The `tool-tracker.sh` hook increments tool counts on each `PostToolUse` event
3. Token metrics are read from Claude Code's JSONL transcript files
4. All metrics are aggregated and displayed in the TUI
