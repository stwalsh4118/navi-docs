## Prerequisites

- **Go** 1.25+ (for building from source)
- **tmux** (required for session management)
- **jq** (optional, for automatic hook configuration merging)
- **gh** CLI (optional, for GitHub PR detection and the `github-issues` task provider)

## Quick Install

Clone the repository and run the install script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stwalsh4118/navi.git
cd navi
./install.sh
```

The install script will:

1. Create `~/.claude-sessions/` and `~/.claude-sessions/hooks/`
2. Copy hook scripts (`notify.sh`, `tool-tracker.sh`) with execute permissions
3. Merge hook configuration into `~/.claude/settings.json`
4. Build the `navi` binary

If `jq` is not available, the script will save the hook configuration for manual merging and provide instructions.

## Building Manually

```bash
go build -o navi ./cmd/navi
```

Move the binary to a directory in your `$PATH`:

```bash
mv navi ~/.local/bin/
```

## Hook Setup

Navi relies on Claude Code hooks to receive status updates. The hooks are configured in `~/.claude/settings.json` and fire shell scripts that write session status JSON files.

### Hook Events

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Marks session as working |
| `Stop` | Marks session as done |
| `PermissionRequest` | Marks session as needing approval |
| `SessionEnd` | Marks session as offline |
| `PostToolUse` | Clears stale permission status |
| `SubagentStart` | Tracks teammate agent start |
| `SubagentStop` | Tracks teammate agent stop |
| `TeammateIdle` | Tracks teammate idle state |
| `TaskCompleted` | Tracks task completion |

### Manual Hook Configuration

If automatic merging failed, add the hook arrays from `hooks/config.json` to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude-sessions/hooks/notify.sh working"
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude-sessions/hooks/notify.sh done"
      }
    ],
    "PermissionRequest": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude-sessions/hooks/notify.sh permission"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See `hooks/config.json` in the repository for the complete configuration.

## First Run

1. Start one or more Claude Code sessions inside tmux
2. Run `navi` from any terminal
3. Sessions will appear as they send status updates via hooks
4. Use `j`/`k` to navigate, `Enter` to attach to a session
